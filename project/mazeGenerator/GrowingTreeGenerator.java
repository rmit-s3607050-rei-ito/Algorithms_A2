  // Growing tree maze generator. As it is very general, here we implement as
  // "usually pick the most recent cell, but occasionally pick a random cell"

  // 1. Pick a random starting cell and add it to set Z (initially Z is empty,
  // after addition it contains just the starting cell).

  // 2. Using a particular strategy (see below) select a cell b from Z. If cell b has unvisited neighbouring
  // cells, randomly select a neighbour, carve a path to it, and add the selected neighbour to set Z.
  // If b has no unvisited neighbours, remove it from Z.

  // 3. Repeat step 2 until Z is empty.
  // Depending on what strategy is used to select a cell from V , we obtain different behaviour. If we
  // select the newest cell added to V , then this is the same as recursive backtracker. If we randomly select
  // a cell in V , then this is similar to Primâ€™s generation approach. Other strategies can be a mixture of
  // both (have a try!).

  // Likelihood of random cell selection vs selecting nearest cell
