From Discussion Board:
For 'Recursive Backtracker' and 'Bidirectional Recursive Backtracker', as student reported that a recursive algorithm experienced an 'out of memory' issue, we have decided to only test those algorithms on mazes up to a size of 30 x 30.

For the rest generators and solvers, the tested mazes are still up to a size of 100 x 100.
